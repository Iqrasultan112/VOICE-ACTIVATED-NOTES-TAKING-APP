# VOICE-ACTIVATED-NOTES-TAKING-APP
This Python script builds a simple Notes App GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to add, save, and manage notes. It incorporates speech recognition functionality for converting spoken words into text, enabling users to add notes via speech input. The app also supports loading and displaying previously saved notes.Upon execution, the script initializes the main window of the application with a title "Notes App" and sets its dimensions and background color. It creates two notebook widgets: `notes_frame` on the left for adding new notes and `saved_notes_frame` on the right for displaying saved notes.
